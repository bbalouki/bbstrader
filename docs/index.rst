Overview
--------

BBSTrader is a trading system suite developed for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) and IBKR platforms (coming soon), designed to offer a comprehensive set of tools for developing, backtesting, executing, and managing a wide array of trading strategies. With an emphasis on algorithmic and quantitative trading, it provides traders with a robust platform for exploring and deploying sophisticated trading strategies.

``bbstrader`` is comprised of several key modules, each focusing on specific aspects of trading strategy development and execution:

- **Backtesting Module (btengine)**: Enables traders to rigorously test their trading strategies using historical data to evaluate performance before live deployment.
- **Trading Strategies Module**: A collection of predefined trading strategies, including ARIMA+GARCH models, Kalman Filters, and Simple Moving Averages, equipped with risk management through Hidden Markov Models.
- **MetaTrader5 Module (metatrader)**: Facilitates the direct execution of trading strategies on the MetaTrader 5 platform, supporting real-time trading across multiple financial instruments.
- **Models Module**: Serves as a framework for implementing various types of financial models (risk management models, machine learning models, etc.).
- **Time Series Module (tseries)**: Designed for conducting advanced time series analysis in financial markets. It leverages statistical models and algorithms to perform tasks such as cointegration testing, volatility modeling, and filter-based estimation to assist in trading strategy development, market analysis, and financial data exploration.

Features
--------

- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Assess the performance of trading strategies with historical market data to optimize parameters and strategies for live trading environments.
- **Integrated Risk Management**: Leverage advanced risk management techniques to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain control over risk exposure.
- **Automated Trading**: Execute trades automatically on the MT5 platform, with support for managing orders, positions, and risk in real-time.
- **Flexible Framework**: Customize existing strategies or develop new ones with the flexible, modular architecture designed to accommodate traders' evolving needs.
- **Copy Trading**: Implement copy trading strategies to replicate the trades of experienced traders or signal providers to enhance trading performance.

---------------

Before you can use ``bbstrader`` and ``metatrader``, you need to have MetaTrader 5 (MT5) installed on your computer and an active MT5 trading account. 
This module currently supports three brokers, `Admirals Group AS <https://cabinet.a-partnership.com/visit/?bta=35537&brand=admiralmarkets>`_ , `Just Global Markets Ltd. <https://one.justmarkets.link/a/tufvj0xugm/registration/trader>`_, and `FTMO <https://trader.ftmo.com/?affiliates=JGmeuQqepAZLMcdOEQRp>`_ so you need to create a demo or live account with one of them.
